In the Git checkout, the `src/` directory contains a symbolic link to
`../casatables_impl/casacore`. When building from a checkout, this works
straightforwardly. When creating a package that is uploaded to crates.io,
Cargo does the right thing and copies over all of the files, which is a bit
bloaty but means that we can maintain the helpful casatables/casatables_impl
split.
